        “Our Father, give us the faith to believe that it is possible for us to
        live victoriously even in the midst of dangerous opportunity that we
        call crisis. Help us see that there is something better than patient
        endurance or keeping a stiff upper lip, and that whistling in the dark
        is not really bravery. Bless us with the greatness of humility, that we
        may feel no shame in expressing our need of a living God. Forgive the
        pride that causes us to strut about like knights in shining armour when
        we know full well that we are but beggars in tattered rags. Plant a seed
        of faith in us today and nurture it that it may grow. Then, trusting in
        thee may we have the faith that goes singing in the rain, knowing that
        all things work together for good to them that love Thee. Through Jesus
        Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

        “Silence is the way to make solitude a reality. The Desert Faithers
        praise silence as the safest way to God. “I have often repented of
        having spoken,” Arsenius said, “But never of having remained silent.”
        One day Archbishop Theophilus came to the desert to visit Abba Pambo.
        But Abba Pambo did not speak to him. When the brethren finally said to
        Pambo, “Father, say something to the archbishop, so that he may be
        edified,” he replied: “If he is not edified by my silence, he will not
        be edified by my speech.”

        the table of daily life, I seem to hear the echo of Jesus’ words to the
        woman at the well, “If you but knew the gift of God…” Whether God weeps
        at the beauty and potential of our lives at birth or the lost potential
        of graced moments along the way, I hear that voice urging us to claim
        our splendor and our glory. “If you but knew the gift of God…” <br />
        The gift of God is the Divine Indwelling. It comes quietly into your
        frailty at baptism. You become a tabernacle for the Source of Life. When
        you come to understand this old yet often forgotten truth, you will know
        what is meant by the words heaven on earth. This is it! You are
        beginning to live heaven on earth in the Divine Indwelling. You, frail
        earth-creature, having given your frailty over to God, have created a
        place of splendor within the depth of your being, a holy and eternal

        “Prayer is the language of Christian community,” writes Henri Nouwen.
        “In prayer the nature of the community becomes visible because in prayer
        we direct ourselves to the one who forms the community. We do not pray
        to each other, but together we pray to God, who calls us and makes us a
        new people.” It is in the act of worship that we experience the gift of
        community at its deepest level. In the eucharistic offering of bread and
        wine, our brokenness and separation are offered in symbolic union with
        the broken body of Christ, and then given back transformed and made
        whole as a sign of that new community brought into being by his
        resurrection. If we are to understand what it means to be
        community-builders, we must do so from this perspective. Ministry is
        given to us by God. It remains authentic only as it is empowered at its
        source, supported and guided by the community of faith, and then shared
        with others. “Make me an instrument of your peace,” prayed St. Francis.
        “Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon;
        where there is discord, union.” This is what it means to exercise a
        community-building ministry, to be in the fullest sense, an ambassador
        of reconciliation.”

        “God himself must free the man who is unfree and incapable of winning
        his own freedom, must free him for freedom. He can turn “slaves of sin”
        into “slaves of God”, who have been “set free from sin” (Rom. 6:20, 22).
        God does this for the man who believes, whether Jew or Gentile, through
        his eschatological act of salvation in Jesus Christ. In Christ, the new
        free man, God promised and revealed and created the way to a new and
        true freedom. Sinful man thinks he can find freedom by self-confidently
        controlling himself and his own life. But he is warned that he can only
        win freedom by abdicating this control to another – not to men, who
        would reduce him to the rank of a slave, but to God, who will accept him
        as his child. To be able to do what one wants is only the appearance of
        freedom; true freedom is to will what God does.”

          People need the truth. It does them no good to remain ignorant. They
          need the freedom that comes through the grace of simplicity. And if we
          are to bring the whole counsel of God, we must give attention to these
          issues that enslave people so savagely. Martin Luther is reported to
          have said, “If you preach the Gospel in all aspects with the exception
          of the issues which deal specifically with your time you are not
          preaching the Gospel at all.”{' '}

          Church. We must boldly teach the essential connection between the
          inner and outer aspects of simplicity. We can no longer allow people
          to engage in pious exercises that are divorced from the hard social
          realities of life. Nor can we tolerate a radical social witness that
          is devoid of inward spiritual vitality. Our preaching and teaching
          needs to hold these elements in unity. If our teaching is centered in
          the biblical text, we will find literally hundreds of examples - from
          Abraham to St. John, from the wisdom literature to the apocalyptic

        purpose of prayer: to glorify the name of God. The scales fell from my
        eyes. I saw in a new light the misuse of prayer and the difficulties
        connected with prayer as well as the place of our own efforts in prayer.
        Prayer life has its own laws, as all the rest of life has. The
        fundamental law in prayer is this: Prayer is given and ordained for the
        purpose of glorifying God. Prayer is the appointed way of giving Jesus
        an opportunity to exercise his supernatural powers of salvation. And in
        so doing he desires to make use of us.”

        is why I believe in personal prayer, and why every day I wait to meet

        prayer-filled day sees a meeting with the God who comes; every night
        which we faithfully put at his disposal is full of his presence. And his
        coming and his presence are not only the result of our waiting or a
        prize for our efforts: They are his decision, based on his love freely
        poured out. His coming is bound to his promise, not to our works or
        virtue. We have not earned the meeting with God because we have served
        him faithfully in our brethren, or because we have heaped up such a pile
        of virtue as to shine before Heaven. God is thrust onward by his love,
        not attracted by our beauty. He comes even in moments when we have done
        everything wrong, when we have done nothing…when we have sinned.”

        though it were the last, the most miserable, the most deformed of souls,
        God will precipitate himself into it in order, through it, to look at
        and listen to the afflicted. Only as time passes does the soul become
        aware that he is there. But, though it finds no name for him, wherever
        the afflicted are loved for themselves alone, it is God who is present.
        God is not present, even if we invoke him, where the afflicted are
        merely regarded as an occasion for doing good. They may even be loved on
        this account, but then they are in their natural role, the role of

        “On the one hand, no minister can keep his own experience of life hidden
        from those he wants to help. Nor should he want to keep it hidden. While
        a doctor can still be a good doctor even when his private life is
        severely disrupted, no minister can offer service without a constant and
        vital acknowledgment of his own experiences. On the other hand, it would
        be very easy to misuse the concept of the wounded healer by defending a
        form of spiritual exhibitionism. A minister who talks in the pulpit
        about his own personal problems is of no help to his congregation, for
        no suffering human being is helped by someone who tells him that he has
        the same problems. Remarks such as, “Don’t worry because I suffer from
        the same depression, confusion and anxiety as you do,” help no one. This
        spiritual exhibitionism adds little faith to little faith and creates
        narrowmindedness instead of new perspectives. Open wounds stink and do
        no heal. Making one’s own wounds a source of healing, therefore, does
        not call for a sharing of superficial personal pains but for a constant
        willingness to see one’s own pain and suffering as rising from the depth
        of the human condition which all men share.”

        The crucifixion articulates God’s odd freedom, his strange justice, and
        his peculiar power. It is this freedom [read religion of God’s freedom],
        justice [read economics of sharing], and power [read politics of
        justice] which break the power of the old age and bring it to death.
        Without the cross, prophetic imagination will likely be as strident and
        as destructive as that which it criticizes. The cross is the assurance
        that effective prophetic criticism is done not by an outsider but always

        pain of the criticized one.”

        action of God whose province it is to create new futures for people and
        to let them be amazed in the midst of despair… The resurrection of Jesus

        Rather, it is the ultimate act of prophetic energizing in which a new

        minister?” is not answered by “I am sorry, he has someone in his office”
